            <h3 id="by-using-the-redvid-app-you-agree-to-the-privacy-policy-given-here">This statement pertains to HSC Advisory</h3>
            <p>At HSC Advisory, safeguarding your privacy is our utmost concern, and we are committed to preserving the confidentiality and security of the personal information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy delineates how HSC Advisory collects, manages, and safeguards your personal data in relation to our digital platform and our comprehensive range of business consultancy services, including corporate restructuring, economic analysis, forensic investigations, litigation support, healthcare solutions, strategic communications, and technological services ("Professional Services").</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="log-data">Applicability of this Statement</h3>
            <p>
              This statement applies to personal data that HSC Advisory collects and/or utilizes as a data controller, as defined by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar legislation (e.g., Brazil's Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, the DIFC Data Protection Law of 2020, etc.). California residents should review the dedicated section addressing their specific rights. When delivering Professional Services, we occasionally handle personal data as a data processor (e.g., hosting client information on our e-discovery platforms), meaning we process it solely under our clients' directives. If our use of your personal data is not covered by this statement, you may need to contact the client (and data controller) responsible for your information. For the purposes of this statement, "Personal Data" refers to information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or can reasonably be associated or linked with a specific person or household.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="cookies">Digital Tracking Policy</h3>
            <p>
              HSC Advisory is dedicated to protecting the privacy of your personal data and maintaining transparency regarding the technologies it employs. This Digital Tracking Policy elucidates how and why HSC Advisory utilizes cookies and similar technologies to enhance and optimize your user experience when interacting with our digital platforms.</p>
              <p>Our digital platform employs cookies and comparable tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience, analyze platform traffic, and tailor content. You can manage your preferences for these technologies through your browser configuration.</p>

            <p>
              HSC Advisory implements appropriate technical safeguards, security protocols, and procedures to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized alteration, or destruction. Our measures include confidentiality requirements for personnel and service providers, access restrictions based on necessity, and appropriate training for our staff. We maintain comprehensive data incident response protocols, and our IT security program undergoes periodic audits.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;" id="links-to-other-sites">Your Data Rights</h3>

Generally, this period aligns with the duration of your relationship or contract with us, plus an additional period reflecting the time during which legal claims might be brought post-termination. Certain records, such as call recordings, tax documents, and compliance-related information, may need to be retained longer.
